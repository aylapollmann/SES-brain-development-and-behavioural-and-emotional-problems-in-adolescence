# Abstract
Socioeconomic disparities in adolescent mental health and later outcomes are well-established, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. This study examined associations among SES, structural white matter development, and behavioural and emotional problems across three time points using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD, N ≈ 12.000, 9-15 years, USA).

First, K-means clustering was used to identify distinct trajectories of white matter connectivity, measured by fractional anisotropy (FA), which were then related to SES measures (≈ age 10) and behavioural and emotional issues (≈ age 14) through logistic regression. Second, a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) examined time-varying relations between fluctuating SES (income-to-needs ratio), white matter development, and behavioural and emotional issues. 

Results showed distinct white matter trajectories, but SES indicators were unrelated to these trajectories after controlling for gender. Gender differences in FA trajectory were observed, and girls had more behavioural and emotional issues at age 14. The RI-CLPM showed a small positive correlation between higher SES and higher FA at age 12 (β = 0.023, p = .023) and dynamic relationships between SES and behavioural and emotional problems; more problems at T1 were associated with lower SES at T2 (β = -0.058, p = .001), but higher SES at T2 was related to more problems at T3 (β = 0.140, p = .014).  

These findings highlight the complex relationships between SES, brain development, and adolescent well-being, revealing both stable long-term associations and age-dependent effects during adolescence. These results underscore the need for longitudinal approaches in understanding adolescent (neuro)development, considering factors such as gender and diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.
